# Frontend Rewrite Implementation Ledger

This file tracks implementation evidence for the React/Ant Design migration goal without changing the source goal documents.

## 2026-06-23 Foundation Batch

### Scope
- Added the first isolated React, TypeScript, Vite app under `frontend/app`.
- Built the static app output into `frontend/dist/app` with `/app/` routing.
- Added a neutral migration entry from the existing static UI at `/` to `/app/`.
- Added a backend `/api/ag-ui` foundation router and typed AG-UI mapping layer.

### Builder Evidence
- AG-UI backend foundation was implemented by worker subagent `019ef245-4e7b-7f71-a898-664b7b1dea1e`.
- React app shell foundation was implemented in the main workspace and still requires a dedicated reviewer pass before the subsystem is marked complete.

### Verification
- `npm run typecheck` in `frontend/app` passed.
- `npm run test -- --run` in `frontend/app` passed with 3 tests.
- `npm run build` in `frontend/app` passed and emitted `frontend/dist/app`.
- `uv run --extra dev pytest -q tests/unit_tests/interfaces/server/test_ag_ui_mapping.py tests/unit_tests/interfaces/server/test_ag_ui_router.py tests/unit_tests/interfaces/server/test_app.py::test_runtime_bundle_wires_runtime_app_with_fake_modules` passed with 19 tests.

### Known Follow-Ups
- Add reviewer subagent passes for the AG-UI backend and React app shell foundation.
- Wire the React runtime stream client into active run execution and replay.
- Replace temporary migration switch labels before final release cleanup.
- Split Ant Design-heavy surfaces by route or feature if bundle size becomes a release blocker.
